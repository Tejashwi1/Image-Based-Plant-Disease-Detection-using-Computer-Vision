# Leaf Disease Detection Project

This project is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to identify whether a leaf is diseased or healthy based on the provided images.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the code:

### Step 1: Download the Dataset

Download the leaf dataset from Kaggle or UCI and save it in your local directory.

### Step 2: Import the Dataset

Run the Import_dataset.py file in your integrated development environment (IDE) to import and preprocess the dataset.

### Step 3: Run Architecture

Execute the Architecture.py file to set up and train the Convolutional Neural Network.

### Step 4: Run Prediction

Finally, run the Predict.py file to make predictions on new leaf images.

## Dataset Organization

Due to the large size of the dataset, it's recommended to download any leaf dataset from Kaggle or UCI. Afterward, classify the dataset into two separate folders: "Healthy Leafs" and "Diseased Leafs." Save these two folders into another folder named 'Dataset' and place it in the same location as the Import_dataset.py file.

## Notes

- Ensure that your IDE is configured correctly with the necessary dependencies.
- Make sure to provide the correct file paths and names in the code.
- Adjust hyperparameters and configurations in the code as needed.
